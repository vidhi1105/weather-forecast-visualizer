# 🌦️ Weather Forecast Visualization using OpenWeatherMap API

## 📌 Project Overview

This project visualizes **5-day weather forecasts** for a selected city using the **OpenWeatherMap API**. The forecasts are plotted with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to display:

* 🌡️ Temperature trends
* 💧 Humidity variation
* 🔥 Temperature variation heatmap
* 📅 Real-time timestamps and formatting for better analysis

## 📂 Features

* ✅ Fetches real-time forecast data using API
* ✅ Line plots for temperature trends
* ✅ Bar plots for humidity
* ✅ Heatmap of temperature variation (hourly)
* ✅ PDF report generation of the graphs
* ✅ Clean and easy-to-understand visualization with legends, grid lines, and axis labels
